**Git Workflow Best Practices:**

**1. Pull Before You Start Work:**
   - Always pull the latest changes from the relevant branch to ensure your local copy is up-to-date.
   - **Command:**
     ```bash
     git checkout lessons/commands
     git pull origin lessons/commands
     ```

**2. Working with Branches:**
   - Switch to the branch you intend to work on and ensure it's updated.
   - **Command to switch and pull:**
     ```bash
     git checkout lessons/commands
     git pull origin lessons/commands
     ```

**3. Merging Updates from Main to Feature Branches:**
   - Regularly merge updates from `main` to your feature branch `lessons/commands` to keep it current.
   - **Command to merge:**
     ```bash
     git checkout lessons/commands
     git merge main
     ```

**4. Updating Feature Branches and Later Merging to Main:**
   - Develop and update on feature branches like `lessons/commands`, then merge these updates back to the `main` branch for integration.
   - **Command to merge feature branch to main:**
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git merge lessons/commands
     git push origin main
     ```

**5. Pushing Changes:**
   - After making changes and committing them on your branch `lessons/commands`, push them to ensure collaborators have access to your updates.
   - **Command to push:**
     ```bash
     git push origin lessons/commands
     ```

**6. Setting Upstream for Branches:**
   - When pushing a new branch for the first time, set the upstream to simplify future push and pull commands.
   - **Command to set upstream:**
     ```bash
     git push --set-upstream origin lessons/commands
     ```

**7. Pulling Specific Branches:**
   - When working on a specific branch like `lessons/commands`, regularly pull updates specifically from that branch to ensure it is current.
   - **Command to pull from a specific branch:**
     ```bash
     git pull origin lessons/commands
     ```

**8. Managing Branch Updates:**
   - Understand that pushing to one branch does not update other branches; updates need to be merged across branches as needed.
   - **Commands for branch updates:**
     ```bash
     git checkout lessons/commands
     git merge main
     git push origin lessons/commands
     ```

These guidelines ensure that your work is aligned with your team and that your branches are managed effectively for both individual and collaborative efforts.
