Creating and Managing Git Branches

A. Creating Branches in Git:
Using git branch:
This command creates a new branch but doesn't switch your working directory to it.
git branch feature/lesson

Switch to the Newly Created Branch:
1. git checkout feature/lesson
2. git switch feature/lesson

Switch Back to the Main Branch:
1. git checkout main
2. git switch main

B. Create a New Branch and Switch to It:
1. Using git checkout -b:
Command: git checkout -b feature/lesson

2. Using git switch -c:
Command: git switch -c feature/lesson

Similar to git checkout -b, this command creates and switches to the new branch feature/lesson. Introduced in Git 2.23, git switch -c provides a more intuitive syntax focused specifically on branch operations.


Switching Between Branches:
To switch to an existing branch:
git checkout feature/lesson
or
git switch feature/lesson

Pushing Branches to a Remote Repository:
When you first push a new branch to a remote repository:
git push -u origin feature/lesson

Setting Tracking Information for Git Branches
Setting Tracking Information" part refers to configuring your local Git branch to establish a link or relationship with a corresponding branch on a remote repository. This configuration tells Git where to push and pull changes by default for the current branch, simplifying future commands.

How to Set Tracking Information
# Using the -u option, which is shorthand for --set-upstream
git push -u origin lessons/commands
# This command sets the upstream (tracking) reference for the local branch 'lessons/commands'
# to 'origin/lessons/commands'. Future 'git pull' or 'git push' commands executed from this
# branch will automatically reference 'origin/lessons/commands'.

# Using the --set-upstream option explicitly
git push --set-upstream origin lessons/commands
# This does exactly the same as the -u option, setting the upstream tracking branch for
# 'lessons/commands' to 'origin/lessons/commands', simplifying future pull and push operations.


Pulling Changes:
To update your local branch with changes from the remote branch:
git pull
This command fetches changes from the remote branch that is tracking the current local branch and merges them into your local branch.
