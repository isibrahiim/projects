git clone [Repository URL]
Replace [Repository URL] with the URL of the repository you wish to clone.

Git Push:

When to Use: After making changes, adding new files, or committing updates in your local repository, to share these changes with others or back them up on a remote server.
Command:
git push origin main
This pushes your commits from the local main branch to the remote repository's main branch. Adjust the branch names as necessary.

Git Pull:
Purpose: Updates your local repository with changes from a remote repository.
When to Use: To keep your local repository up-to-date with the latest changes made by others in the remote repository.
